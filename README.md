# simpleBenefitsTracker

Downgraded to Angular v.16 for compatibility with the Ontario Design System.

Used Visual Basics as a backend as a mini SAMS with Angular front end.

Able to add and remove clients, update benefits, and add and remove appointments. Backend able to accommodate getting, adding, removing and updating for all three categories.

If your local backend runs on a different port from https://localhost:44333/, please update src/environments/environment.ts with the correct local URL.
